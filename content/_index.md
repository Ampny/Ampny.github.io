# Bio

I am a chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85. I am 
the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, occurring only as
the decay product of various heavier elements. All of my isotopes are
short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. 

A pure sample of myself has never been assembled, because any macroscopic
specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.
