# Bio

I am a student at Cornell University studying Engineering Physics with a focus on Computer Science. I love the natural world and am compelled to explore it and learn our place in it. Currently, I work in space science and planetary exploration, which I find especially wonderful. I have worked at NASA Langley on spacecraft atmospheric re-entry trajectories, and I am currently working at Cornell to understand the surface of Saturn's moon Titan using remote sensing. 

I am graduating from Cornell in May 2024. After I graduate, I plan to live in a Buddhist monastery for some time, and possibly hike across the country. If you like, check the blog on this website for updates!
