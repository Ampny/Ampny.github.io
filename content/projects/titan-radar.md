description: "On Titan, Saturn's largest moon, most of the surface terrain is plains. Although plains are so prevelant on Titan, we have a poor understanding of their basic properties. The science questions we are asking are relatively basic! What is the ground made of? How are the plains formed? In this paper, I made a robust estimate of the surface composition of Titan's plains using RADAR modeling techniques with data collected by the Cassini satellite."

*In progress: The research is ongoing. When it is complete this summer, this page will be filled out.*
