description: "I was playing around with origami when I had the idea for this inflatable twisting actuator. In my last two weeks with the Gat Research Group at the Technion I had the idea, did some back-of-the-napkin math to show it could work, and rapidly prototyped with Ezra Ben-Abu to develop and test a working model. I returned to my studies at Cornell, but the lab developed the idea for the next two years and published a paper on the device in 2024. They found that the simple design allowed the actuator to be made very, very small. With an inner radius of just 44 Âµm it is the smallest inflatable multistable actuator ever made, and is being developed for use in a catheter for robotic surgery!"

Here are some details about my first project:

- It was challenging.
- I learned a lot.
- It's something I'm proud of.
