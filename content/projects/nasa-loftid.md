description: "The Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator (LOFTID) was a NASA mission to test an experimental heatshield for use on Mars. During the test, the instrumentation to record LOFTID's trajectory and attitude broke, making analysis of the mission very difficult. I invented a system to reconstruct the trajectory of the LOFTID mission using views of the earth and moon from onboard cameras. The system used computer vision algorithms, live orbital tracking of the Earth and Moon, and a custom-built Kalman filter to synthesize the camera and orbital data into a reconstructed trajectory."

Here are some details about my first project:

- It was challenging.
- I learned a lot.
- It's something I'm proud of.
