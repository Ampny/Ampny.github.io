Award from world-renowned Bill Nye "the Science Guy" for exceptional undergraduate research and communication. We spent a day together, talking about science and the strange and wonderful world we live in. We also discussed his time with Carl Sagan and what it means to be a scientist -- to approach the job with both joy and due respect.
