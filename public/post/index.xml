      <description>This last Monday I went to see my good friend Isiah&amp;rsquo;s piano recital at Ithaca College. He is no joke, and one of the most dedicated people I know. He plays a consistent 8 hours a day, every day &amp;ndash; he loves it! It was obvious for anyone watching. I was struck by his playing, and what really got me was his performance of the Piano Sonata No. 4 in F-sharp major, Op.</description>

      <description>What kind of information can be held in a text? A western approach might be mathematical, defining exactly what data some sequence of symbols can hold. Compressing that information then means using some clever method or a machine to rewrite it into a form that takes up less room, and still holds all of the original information. The laws of mathematics put very strict limits on this type of compression, though.</description>
